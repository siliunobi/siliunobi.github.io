<!-- <b>I'm on the job market!</b> I've fulfilled all the goals I set for myself before coming to ETH Zurich, and along the way, I’ve come to truly understand the wisdom in the parting words of Prof. José Meseguer: <i>”Discover what it means to work alongside some of the brightest minds in the world.”</i>  Now, a new chapter awaits. I'm eager to see where fate will lead me next. I believe everything unfolds in the best possible way! -->

I am Si Liu, though I often go by Nobi. I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html'>Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>, [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html).

My research lies at the intersection of <b>formal methods</b>, <b>software engineering</b>, <b>systems</b>, and <b>security</b>, with a strong focus on
<i>leveraging formal verification techniques to build reliable, secure, and performant distributed systems</i>. 
In recent years, I have worked on verifying and validating both the <i>designs and deployments</i> of  <b>database systems</b> and <b>DNS</b>, addressing not only <i>qualitative</i> (e.g., reliability and security) but also <i>quantitative</i> (e.g., availability and scalability) aspects. 
I am also deeply interested in the <b>intersection of these areas with AI</b>: <i>both</i> in applying AI techniques to strengthen testing and verification, and in developing rigorous methods for verifying AI-powered systems themselves.

Before I came to Texas,
I was a Senior Researcher (Deutsch: Oberassistent) in the <a href='https://infsec.ethz.ch/'>Information Security Group</a> at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), led by Prof. 
[David Basin](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/basin/), 
where I received the Career Seed Award.  I also previously worked as a postdoc in the same group.  
I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Illinois  Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [José Meseguer](https://formal.cs.illinois.edu/meseguer/), 
where I worked on design, verification and automatic implementation of correct-by-construction distributed database systems. 

<!-- Before that, I obtained an MS in Computer Science and a BE in Software Engineering, both from 
[East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/). -->

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size: 1.5em;">:rocket:</span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size: 1.2em;">I am recruiting PhD, Master, and undergrad students to join my group.
