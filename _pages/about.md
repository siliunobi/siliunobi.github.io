<b>I'm on the job market!</b> I've fulfilled all the goals I set for myself before coming to ETH Zurich, and along the way, I’ve come to truly understand the wisdom in the parting words of Prof. José Meseguer: <i>”Discover what it means to work alongside some of the brightest minds in the world.”</i>  Now, a new chapter awaits. I'm eager to see where fate will lead me next. I believe everything unfolds in the best possible way!

I'm a Senior Researcher 
(Deutsch: Oberassistent) in the <a href='https://infsec.ethz.ch/'>Information Security Group</a> at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), led by Prof. 
[David Basin](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/basin/), 
where I received the <b>Career Seed Award</b>.  I also previously worked as a postdoc in the same group.

My research interests encompass formal methods (FM), software engineering (SE), and distributed systems, with a particular emphasis on <b>applying FM/SE techniques to build reliable, secure, and efficient distributed systems</b>. 
My current work focuses on verifying and validating the <b><i>designs & deployments</i></b> of  databases and DNS, addressing both <b><i>qualitative</i></b> (e.g., reliability and security) <b><i>& quantitative</i></b> (e.g., availability and scalability) aspects. I have also recently developed an interest in verifying AI systems. 


I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Illinois  Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [José Meseguer](https://formal.cs.illinois.edu/meseguer/), 
where I worked on design, verification and automatic implementation of correct-by-construction distributed database systems. 
 Before that, I obtained an MS in Computer Science and a BE in Software Engineering, both from 
[East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/).
