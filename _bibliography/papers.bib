	abstract = {Modern databases embrace weak isolation levels to cater for highly available transactions. However, weak isolation bugs have recently manifested in many production databases. This raises the concern of whether database implementations actually deliver their promised isolation guarantees in practice. In this paper we present Plume, the first efficient, complete, black-box checker for weak isolation levels. Plume builds on modular, fine-grained transactional anomalous patterns, with which we establish sound and complete characterizations of representative weak isolation levels, including read committed, read atomicity, and transactional causal consistency. Plume leverages a novel combination of two techniques, vectors and tree clocks, to accelerate isolation checking. Our extensive assessment shows that Plume can reproduce all known violations in a large collection of anomalous database execution histories, detect new isolation bugs in three production databases along with informative counterexamples, find more weak isolation anomalies than the state-of-the-art checkers, and efficiently validate isolation guarantees under a wide variety of workloads.}

However, they focus just on optimizing transactional reads, and thus overlook crucial factors, such as the efficiency of writes, which also impact the overall system performance. Motivated by a recent study on Twitter's workloads showing the prominence of write-heavy workloads in practice, we make a substantial step towards performance-optimal distributed transactions by also aiming to optimize writes, a fundamentally new dimension to this problem. We propose a new design objective and establish impossibility results with respect to the achievable isolation levels. Guided by these results, we present two new transaction algorithms with different isolation guarantees that fulfill this design objective. Our evaluation demonstrates that these algorithms outperform the state of the art.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) makes it challenging to verify not only the networks themselves but also the hosting DNN-controlled systems. Reachability analysis of these systems faces the same challenge. Existing approaches rely on over-approximating DNNs using simpler polynomial models. However, they suffer from low efficiency and large overestimation, and are restricted to specific types of DNNs. This paper presents a novel abstraction-based approach to bypass the crux of over-approximating DNNs in reachability analysis. Specifically, we extend conventional DNNs by inserting an additional abstraction layer, which abstracts a real number to an interval for training. The inserted abstraction layer ensures that the values represented by an interval are indistinguishable to the network for both training and decision-making. Leveraging this, we devise the first black-box reachability analysis approach for DNN-controlled systems, where trained DNNs are only queried as black-box oracles for the actions on abstract states. Our approach is sound, tight, efficient, and agnostic to any DNN type and size. The experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks show that the DNNs trained by using our approach exhibit comparable performance, while the reachability analysis of the corresponding systems becomes more amenable with significant tightness and efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art white-box approaches.},

	abstract = {The robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial to the hosting system’s reliability and security. Formal verification has been demonstrated to be effective in providing provable robustness guarantees. To improve its scalability, over-approximating the non-linear activation functions in DNNs by linear constraints has been widely adopted, which transforms the verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Many efforts have been dedicated to defining the so-called tightest approximations to reduce overestimation imposed by over-approximation. In this paper, we study existing approaches and identify a dominant factor in defining tight approximation, namely the approximation domain of the activation function. We find out that tight approximations defined on approximation domains may not be as tight as the ones on their actual domains, yet existing approaches all rely only on approximation domains. Based on this observation, we propose a novel dual-approximation approach to tighten overapproximations, leveraging an activation function’s underestimated domain to define tight approximation bounds. We implement our approach with two complementary algorithms based respectively on Monte Carlo simulation and gradient descent into a tool called DualApp. We assess it on a comprehensive benchmark of DNNs with different architectures. Our experimental results show that DualApp significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with 100\% − 1000\% improvement on the verified robustness ratio and 10.64\% on average (up to 66.53\%) on the certified lower bound.},

	abstract = {Today’s distributed systems must satisfy both qualitative and quantitative properties. These properties are analyzed using very different formal frameworks: expressive untimed and non-probabilistic frameworks, such as TLA+ and Hoare/separation logics, for qualitative properties; and timed/probabilistic-automaton-based ones, such as Uppaal and Prism, for quantitative ones. This requires developing two quite different models of the same system, without guarantees of semantic consistency between them. Furthermore, it is very hard or impossible to represent intrinsic features of distributed object systems—such as unbounded data structures, dynamic object creation, and an unbounded number of messages—using finite automata. In this paper we bridge this semantic gap, overcome the problem of manually having to develop two different models of a system, and solve the representation problem by: (i) defining a transformation from a very general class of distributed systems (a generalization of Agha’s actor model) that maps an untimed non-probabilistic distributed system model suitable for qualitative analysis to a probabilistic timed model suitable for quantitative analysis; and (ii) proving the two models semantically consistent. We formalize our models in rewriting logic, and can therefore use the Maude tool to analyze qualitative properties, and statistical model checking with PVeStA to analyze quantitative properties. We have automated this transformation and integrated it, together with the PVeStA statistical model checker, into the Actors2PMaude tool. We illustrate the expressiveness of our framework and our tool’s ease of use by automatically transforming untimed, qualitative models of numerous distributed system designs—including an industrial data store and a state-of-the-art transaction system—into quantitative models to analyze and compare the performance of different designs.},

The performance of their transactional reads is particularly critical to the overall system performance, as many real-world database workloads are dominated by reads. Following the SNOW design principle for optimal reads, we develop LORA, a novel SNOW-optimal algorithm for distributed read atomic transactions. LORA completes its reads in exactly one round trip, even in the presence of conflicting writes, without imposing additional overhead to the communication, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art read atomic algorithms.To guide LORA’s development, we present a rewriting-logic-based framework and toolkit for design, verification, implementation, and evaluation of distributed databases. Within the framework, we formalize LORA and mathematically prove its data consistency guarantees. We also apply automatic model checking and statistical verification to validate our proofs and to estimate LORA’s performance. We additionally generate from the formal model a correct-by-construction distributed implementation for testing and performance evaluation under realistic deployments. Our design-level and implementation-based experimental results are consistent, which together demonstrate LORA’s promising data consistency and performance achievement.},

Sigmoid-like neural networks have been adopted in a wide range of applications. Due to their non-linearity, Sigmoid-like activation functions are usually over-approximated for efficient verification, which inevitably introduces imprecision. Considerable efforts have been devoted to finding the so-called tighter approximations to obtain more precise verification results. However, existing tightness definitions are heuristic and lack theoretical foundations. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis of existing neuron-wise characterizations of tightness and reveal that they are superior only on specific neural networks. We then introduce the notion of network-wise tightness as a unified tightness definition and show that computing network-wise tightness is a complex non-convex optimization problem. We bypass the complexity from different perspectives via two efficient, provably tightest approximations. The results demonstrate the promising performance achievement of our approaches over state of the art: (i) achieving up to 251.28\% improvement to certified lower robustness bounds; and (ii) exhibiting notably more precise verification results on convolutional networks.},
