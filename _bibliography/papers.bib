	abstract = {Modern databases embrace weak isolation levels to cater for highly available transactions. However, weak isolation bugs have recently manifested in many production databases. This raises the concern of whether database implementations actually deliver their promised isolation guarantees in practice. In this paper we present Plume, the first efficient, complete, black-box checker for weak isolation levels. Plume builds on modular, fine-grained transactional anomalous patterns, with which we establish sound and complete characterizations of representative weak isolation levels, including read committed, read atomicity, and transactional causal consistency. Plume leverages a novel combination of two techniques, vectors and tree clocks, to accelerate isolation checking. Our extensive assessment shows that Plume can reproduce all known violations in a large collection of anomalous database execution histories, detect new isolation bugs in three production databases along with informative counterexamples, find more weak isolation anomalies than the state-of-the-art checkers, and efficiently validate isolation guarantees under a wide variety of workloads.}

Given the importance of DNS, the question arises of what the fundamental traits are for such attacks. To answer this question, we perform a systematic investigation by establishing a taxonomy of amplification primitives intrinsic to DNS and a framework to analyze their composability. This approach leads to the discovery of a large family of compositional amplification (CAMP) vulnerabilities, which can produce multiplicative effects with message amplification factors of hundreds to thousands. Our measurements with popular DNS implementations and open resolvers indicate the ubiquity and severity of CAMP vulnerabilities and the serious threats they pose to the Internet's crucial naming infrastructure.}

	abstract = {The rapid advance of deep reinforcement learning techniques enables the oversight of safety-critical systems through the utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). This underscores the pressing need to promptly establish certified safety guarantees for such DNN-controlled systems. Most of the existing verification approaches rely on qualitative approaches, predominantly employing reachability analysis. However, qualitative verification proves inadequate for DNN-controlled systems as their behaviors exhibit stochastic tendencies when operating in open and adversarial environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unifying both qualitative and quantitative safety verification problems of DNN-controlled systems. This is achieved by formulating the verification tasks as the synthesis of valid neural barrier certificates (NBCs). Initially, the framework seeks to establish almost-sure safety guarantees through qualitative verification. In cases where qualitative verification fails, our quantitative verification method is invoked, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on probabilistic safety across both infinite and finite time horizons. To facilitate the synthesis of NBCs, we introduce their k-inductive variants. We also devise a simulation-guided approach for training NBCs, aiming to achieve tightness in computing precise certified lower and upper bounds. We prototype our approach into a tool called and showcase its efficacy on four classic DNN-controlled systems.}

	abstract = {The intrinsic complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) makes it challenging to verify not only the networks themselves but also the hosting DNN-controlled systems. Reachability analysis of these systems faces the same challenge. Existing approaches rely on over-approximating DNNs using simpler polynomial models. However, they suffer from low efficiency and large overestimation, and are restricted to specific types of DNNs. This paper presents a novel abstraction-based approach to bypass the crux of over-approximating DNNs in reachability analysis. Specifically, we extend conventional DNNs by inserting an additional abstraction layer, which abstracts a real number to an interval for training. The inserted abstraction layer ensures that the values represented by an interval are indistinguishable to the network for both training and decision-making. Leveraging this, we devise the first black-box reachability analysis approach for DNN-controlled systems, where trained DNNs are only queried as black-box oracles for the actions on abstract states. Our approach is sound, tight, efficient, and agnostic to any DNN type and size. The experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks show that the DNNs trained by using our approach exhibit comparable performance, while the reachability analysis of the corresponding systems becomes more amenable with significant tightness and efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art white-box approaches.},

Nevertheless, SI	anomalies have recently been found in production cloud databases	that claim to provide the SI guarantee.

In this paper we present PolySI, a black-box checker that efciently checks SI and provides understandable counterexamples 	upon detecting violations. PolySI builds on a characterization of	SI using generalized polygraphs (GPs), for which we establish its soundness and completeness. PolySI employs an SMT solver and	also accelerates SMT solving by utilizing a compact constraint encoding of GPs and domain-specifc optimizations for pruning constraints. As our extensive assessment demonstrates, PolySI successfully reproduces all of 2477 known SI anomalies, detects novel SI violations in three production cloud databases, identifes their 	causes, outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box checkers under a wide range of workloads, and can scale up to large workloads.},

	abstract = {Transactions are an important feature of database management systems (DBMSs), as they provide the ACID guarantees for a sequence of database operations. Consequently, approaches have been proposed to automatically find transactional bugs in DBMSs. However, they cannot handle complex operations and predicates common in real-world database queries, and thus miss bugs. This paper introduces a general, effective technique for finding transactional bugs in DBMSs that supports complex SQL queries and predicates. At the conceptual level, we address the test-oracle problem by constructing semantically-equivalent test cases based on fine-grained statement-level dependencies in transactions. At the technical level, we introduce (1) statement-dependency graphs to describe dependencies among SQL statements in transactions, (2) SQL-level instrumentation to capture possible statement-level dependencies, and (3) transactional oracle construction to generate semantically-equivalent test cases using statement-dependency graphs. We also establish the correctness of our approach in generating semantically-equivalent test cases. We have realized our technique as a tool, TxCheck, and evaluated it on three widely-used and well-tested DBMSs, namely TiDB, MySQL, and MariaDB. In total, TxCheck found 56 unique bugs, 52 of which have been confirmed and 18 already fixed. We believe that TxCheck can help solidify DBMSs’ support for transactions thanks to its generality and effectiveness.}

Although DNSSEC provides data authenticity in theory, practical deployments unfortunately are fragile, costly, and typically lacks end-to-end (E2E) guarantees. This motivates us to rethink authentication in DNS fundamentally and introduce RHINE, a secure-by-design Internet naming system. RHINE offloads the authentication of zone delegation to an end-entity PKI and tames the operational complexity in an offline manner, allowing the efficient E2E authentication of zone data during online name resolution. With a novel logging mechanism, Delegation Transparency, RHINE achieves a highly robust trust model that can tolerate the compromise of all but one trusted entities and, for the first time, counters threats from superordinate zones. We formally verify RHINE's security properties using the Tamarin prover. We also demonstrate its practicality and performance advantages with a prototype implementation.}

The major obstacle lies in the large overestimation introduced inherently during training and then transforming the inexplicable decision-making models, i.e., deep neural networks (DNNs), into easy-to-verify models. In this paper, we propose an inverse transform-then-train approach, which first encodes a DNN into an equivalent set of efficiently and tightly verifiable linear control policies and then optimizes them via reinforcement learning. We accompany our inverse approach with a novel neural network model called piece-wise linear decision neural networks (PLDNNs), which are compatible with most existing DRL training algorithms with comparable performance against conventional DNNs. Our extensive experiments show that, compared to DNN-based DRL systems, PLDNN-based systems can be more efficiently and tightly verified with up to 
	438 times speedup and a significant reduction in overestimation. In particular, even a complex 
	12-dimensional DRL system is efficiently verified with up to 7 times deeper computation steps.}

Via abstraction, all perturbed images are mapped into intervals before feeding into neural networks for training. By training on intervals, all the perturbed images that are mapped to the same interval are classified as the same label, rendering the variance of training sets to be small and the loss landscape of the models to be smooth. Consequently, our approach significantly improves the robustness of trained models. For the abstraction, our training method also enables a sound and complete black-box verification approach, which is orthogonal and scalable to arbitrary types of neural networks regardless of their sizes and architectures. We evaluate our method on a wide range of benchmarks in different scales. The experimental results show that our method outperforms state of the art by (i) reducing the verified errors of trained models up to 95.64\%; (ii) totally achieving up to 602.50x speedup; and (iii) scaling up to larger models with up to 138 million trainable parameters.

	abstract = {The robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial to the hosting system’s reliability and security. Formal verification has been demonstrated to be effective in providing provable robustness guarantees. To improve its scalability, over-approximating the non-linear activation functions in DNNs by linear constraints has been widely adopted, which transforms the verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Many efforts have been dedicated to defining the so-called tightest approximations to reduce overestimation imposed by over-approximation. In this paper, we study existing approaches and identify a dominant factor in defining tight approximation, namely the approximation domain of the activation function. We find out that tight approximations defined on approximation domains may not be as tight as the ones on their actual domains, yet existing approaches all rely only on approximation domains. Based on this observation, we propose a novel dual-approximation approach to tighten overapproximations, leveraging an activation function’s underestimated domain to define tight approximation bounds. We implement our approach with two complementary algorithms based respectively on Monte Carlo simulation and gradient descent into a tool called DualApp. We assess it on a comprehensive benchmark of DNNs with different architectures. Our experimental results show that DualApp significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with 100\% − 1000\% improvement on the verified robustness ratio and 10.64\% on average (up to 66.53\%) on the certified lower bound.},

This requires developing two quite different models of the same system, without guarantees of semantic consistency between them. Furthermore, it is very hard or impossible to represent intrinsic features of distributed object systems—such as unbounded data structures, dynamic object creation, and an unbounded number of messages—using finite automata. In this paper we bridge this semantic gap, overcome the problem of manually having to develop two different models of a system, and solve the representation problem by: (i) defining a transformation from a very general class of distributed systems (a generalization of Agha’s actor model) that maps an untimed non-probabilistic distributed system model suitable for qualitative analysis to a probabilistic timed model suitable for quantitative analysis; and (ii) proving the two models semantically consistent. We formalize our models in rewriting logic, and can therefore use the Maude tool to analyze qualitative properties, and statistical model checking with PVeStA to analyze quantitative properties. We have automated this transformation and integrated it, together with the PVeStA statistical model checker, into the Actors2PMaude tool. We illustrate the expressiveness of our framework and our tool’s ease of use by automatically transforming untimed, qualitative models of numerous distributed system designs—including an industrial data store and a state-of-the-art transaction system—into quantitative models to analyze and compare the performance of different designs.},

	abstract = {Distributed read atomic transactions are important building blocks of modern cloud databases that magnificently bridge the gap between data availability and strong data consistency. The performance of their transactional reads is particularly critical to the overall system performance, as many real-world database workloads are dominated by reads. Following the SNOW design principle for optimal reads, we develop LORA, a novel SNOW-optimal algorithm for distributed read atomic transactions. LORA completes its reads in exactly one round trip, even in the presence of conflicting writes, without imposing additional overhead to the communication, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art read atomic algorithms.To guide LORA’s development, we present a rewriting-logic-based framework and toolkit for design, verification, implementation, and evaluation of distributed databases. Within the framework, we formalize LORA and mathematically prove its data consistency guarantees. We also apply automatic model checking and statistical verification to validate our proofs and to estimate LORA’s performance. We additionally generate from the formal model a correct-by-construction distributed implementation for testing and performance evaluation under realistic deployments. Our design-level and implementation-based experimental results are consistent, which together demonstrate LORA’s promising data consistency and performance achievement.},

N-Tube reserves global end-to-end bandwidth along network paths in a distributed, neighbor-based, and tube-fair way. It guarantees that benign bandwidth demands are granted available allocations that are immutable, stable, lower-bounded, andfair, even during adversarial demand bursts. We formalize N-Tube and powerful adversaries as a labeled transition system, and inductively prove its safety and security properties. We also apply statistical model checking to validate our proofs and perform an additional quantitative assessment of N-Tube, providing strong guarantees for protection against DDoS attacks. We are not aware of any other complex networked system designs that have been subjected to a comparable analysis of both their qualitative properties (such as correctness and security) and their quantitative properties (such as performance).},

	abstract = {The robustness of deep neural networks is crucial to modern AI-enabled systems and should be formally verified. Sigmoid-like neural networks have been adopted in a wide range of applications. Due to their non-linearity, Sigmoid-like activation functions are usually over-approximated for efficient verification, which inevitably introduces imprecision. Considerable efforts have been devoted to finding the so-called tighter approximations to obtain more precise verification results. However, existing tightness definitions are heuristic and lack theoretical foundations. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis of existing neuron-wise characterizations of tightness and reveal that they are superior only on specific neural networks. We then introduce the notion of network-wise tightness as a unified tightness definition and show that computing network-wise tightness is a complex non-convex optimization problem. We bypass the complexity from different perspectives via two efficient, provably tightest approximations. The results demonstrate the promising performance achievement of our approaches over state of the art: (i) achieving up to 251.28\% improvement to certified lower robustness bounds; and (ii) exhibiting notably more precise verification results on convolutional networks.},
